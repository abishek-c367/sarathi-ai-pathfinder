# Sarathi AI Tutor

Build "Sarathi AI Tutor", an interactive full-stack AI-tutored course platform.

Key Deliverables for the initial build:
1. Navigation & Role Switcher:
   - Header with student & admin mode toggle (or role-based access with demo switcher for immediate testing), notifications, and user profile.
2. Seed Data / Sample Courses:
   - Seed at least 2 structured, rich demo courses:
     a) "Distributed Systems & Microservices" (Modules: Architecture & Message Queues, Consensus & Raft, Caching & Data Consistency)
     b) "Python & Algorithmic Problem Solving"
   - Each course should have modules, lessons, learning objectives, key concepts, suggested code examples, and pre-configured teaching styles (pacing: balanced, tone: encouraging & intuitive, enforce_quizzes: true).
3. Student Interactive Tutor Workspace (Core Vertical Slice):
   - Interactive split/chat view for lessons:
     - Left/Main pane: AI Tutor conversation stream with typed rich blocks:
       * Explanatory text & intuition breakdowns (Markdown)
       * Code snippets with syntax highlighting and copy button
       * Interactive dynamic Mermaid.js diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams) rendered inline
       * Interactive Checkpoint Quiz widgets (multiple choice or code prediction) with instant submit, grading feedback, and score tracking
     - Right/Sidebar pane: Lesson objectives checklist, mastered concepts progress bar, lesson navigation (next/prev lesson), and course outline.
     - Simulated/Integrated streaming AI tutor engine supporting Groq API configuration (with fallback simulated intelligent responses so the app works immediately out of the box).
   - "Ask a free-form question" vs "Continue lesson" controls.
4. Admin Studio & Course Builder:
   - Admin dashboard with courses list (draft, published, archived), student enrollments, and completion metrics.
   - Course outline builder (add modules, lessons, objectives, key concepts, teaching style options: depth, tone, pacing).
   - Raw content ingestion simulator / prompt generator: paste raw text/notes or upload file to generate a structured module outline.
5. Student Dashboard & Catalog:
   - Course catalog with enrollment, difficulty badges, and progress tracking.
   - Student dashboard showing active courses, progress %, quiz average, and "Resume Lesson" shortcuts.
6. Design: Clean, modern, distraction-free educational UI (dark/light friendly, polished typography, intuitive learning flow).
